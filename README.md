## Github Resources
1. How to create a Github account and your first repository
[guide](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide)

	Your account name should be your name (unless for privacy reasons you'd prefer
	something else) and your repository name could be the course name. 

1. How do I edit the main text?

		In order to edit the README.md file:
		- Click on the README.md file in the top of your repository folder
		- Click on the little pencil icon to edit the file
		- Make any edits you wish
		- Save the file by clicking on the green _Commit changes_ button at the
			bottom of the page

1. Help! I created my account and repository, but I can't find the button 
that says "Create new file" or "Upload files". How do I fix this?

	Answer: It sounds like you forgot to create a README.md file when you created the
	repository. See below.
	

2. Help! I created a new repository but I forgot to check the box that says
"Initialize this repository with a README". How can I create a README file?
	
	Answer: You can either:

	Delete your repository and create a new one, this time with the box
	checked.

	Click where it says "README" and then click "Commit new file" at the 
	bottom of the page that comes up. This will create a "README" file.

5. How do I control the appearance of my README.md file?

	- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
	- [GitHub MarkDown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
	- [Markdown Basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

2. How to upload a file to Github
   - Click on "Upload files"

3. How to create a folder in Github

	Git doesn't store empty folders, so you can only create a new folder when
	you have a file to put in it. Also, you can't create a folder
	when you _upload_ a file. The only way to create a folder is 
	to create a _new_ file, and then to tell Github to put that new file
	in a new folder:
	- Go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder.
	- Click on _Create new file_.
	- On the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you
		 want to create, then type _/_ (which creates the new folder) and then
		 the name of the new file you want to create. The name doesn't matter.
	- Finally, save your new file by pressing the green _Commit new file_
		button at the bottom of the page
	- If you don't need the file, you may delete it now that the folder
		has been created.

4. How to delete a file.
	- Browse to the file in your repository that you want to delete.
	- At the top of the file, click the icon of the trash can
	- Add a short description of why you are deleting this file
	- Finally, save your changes by pressing the green _Commit changes_
		button at the bottom of the page
		
4. How to rename a folder or file
	1. not possible
	2. delete the file
	4. upload file with the correct name 
	   - remember to download the file you want top rename - if you don't have it already!

4. How to [organize folders and files](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github) 
	in Github (move and rename)

4. How to upload a code file so that Github formats it as code

	Use the extension along with the file name. Github recognizes that .ino 
	are code files. Github recognizes many other file extensions as code.

4. How do I create code blocks within in a markdown (.md) file?

	You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and
	after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code
	blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
	function test() {
		console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
		}
```
4. How do I insert an image into my ReadMe?
	- insert images in-line:
	- put images in an images folder
	- use this syntax: ``![picture](/images/picture.jpg)``

4. How do I upload a video?
	
	- Rather than upload a video to a gitHub repository, it is better to upload video to Vimeo or Youtube and to embed those in your post.
